\subsection{Functional Requirements}

After having defined main features of our system we can identify some
functional requirements grouped under each defined actor:
\begin{itemize}
\item GUEST, he can:
\begin{itemize}
\item Sign up.
\item Search for a car near his location.
\item Search for a car near a selected location.
\end{itemize}
\item USER, he can:
\begin{itemize}
\item Log in.
\item Reserve cars.
\item Use a reserved car (unlocking it).
\item View his profile (also his discounts).
\item Modify his profile.
\item View his recent reservations.
\item Search cars near to his location.
\item Search cars near a selected location.
\item Communicate malfunction or damages to the system.
\end{itemize}
\item OPERATOR, he can:
\begin{itemize}
\item Log in.
\item View car's status (battery and location).
\item Receive notification when a car need to be charged.
\item Set a car as available or under maintainance.
\end{itemize}
\item ADMIN, he can:
\begin{itemize}
\item Log in.
\item Add or delete safe areas.
\item Manage car status.
\item Consult car position.
\item Add or delete OPERATORs account.
\item Manage other ADMINs.
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Non-functional Requirements}

\subsubsection{User Interface}
\begin{flushleft}
In order to make PowerEnJoy available for many people as possible,
a Cross-Platform application has to be developed, with a Framework
like Xamarin. In this way, a single application could be developed
and then deployed for Windows Phone, Android and iOS. A Web Application
has also to be developed in order to allow people to use our system
in many way as possible.\\
The User Interface needs to be as user friendly as possible: that's
to say that a user who uses Power EnJoy for the first time should
be able to learn in a few seconds how to make use of it. \\
Here are presented a few screen of the app to provide an example.

\subsubsection{Security}

The system has to satisfy an high level of security regarding the
communication protocol with the cars.\\
The communication with the cars needs to be encrypted in order to
avoid unauthorized unlocks and use. Futhermore the system should have
the way to stop cars when used in an unauthorized way.\\
Regarding the security of payment, the system does't care about it
because it relies on external payment system.\\
Another critical security point is the managing of user's information:
all user informations need to be encrypted before being sent. 

\subsubsection{Availability}

The application needs to be online 24h/day and 7day/week in order
to satisfy all users. This is a constraints because an hour of unavailablity
could induce users to use another car sharing service. To achieve
an high level of availability could be necessary to use a dedicated
server and all the system could be hosted in a cloud platform like
OVH. The system should be able to support a high number of users connected
at the same time and could be necessary to scale resources depending
on this. 

\subsubsection{Portability}

The client-part of the system (application) could be used on any mobile
OS in order to make it available for as many people as possible. It
is expected a Web Application to increase the possible number of users.\\
The server-part of the system could be used on any OS which supports
JVM and DBMS.

\subsubsection{Maintainability}

The system code will be documented in order to make easier future
improvements or changes by other developers. It needs to be clear
how the system works, how the system communicate with cars, and how
the system has been developed.

\subsubsection{Documentation}

These documents will be released in order to well-organize the work
in the way to obtain the best quality-cost ratio as possible:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\boldsymbol{RASD}$: Requirements Analysis and Specification Document,
to well-understand the given problem and to analyze system's boundaries
and goal. RASD is also important to understan system's requirements
and specifications in order to reach the goals.
\item $\mathbf{\boldsymbol{DD}}:$Design Document, to define the structure
of the the system, his tiers, and the interaction between them.
\item $\boldsymbol{ITPD}$: Integration Test Plan Document, to describe
the planning to accomplish the integration test. This document is
supposed to be written before the integration test really happens.
Moreover this document needs to explain to the developer team what
to test, in which sequence, which tools are needed for testing and
wich need to be developed.
\item $\boldsymbol{PP}$: Project Plan, aims at defining a planning for
the project. It regards in particular the estimation of effort and
cost, the scheduling for project's task and the allocation of resources
to tasks.
