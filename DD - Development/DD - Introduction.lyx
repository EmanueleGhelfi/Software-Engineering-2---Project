Purpose
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This software design document describes the architectures and the system
 design of Power EnJoy.
 It's intended mainly for developers but it has a hierarchical structure.
 It completes the RASD and defines the component that led to the satisfaction
 of the goals previous defined.
 It starts from an high level description of the architecture and then it
 goes into detail.

 is decomposed and how individual components work together.

\begin_layout Subsection
Scope
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
PowerEnJoy is a software that manages a car sharing service for electric
 cars.
 The aim of this software is to make simple and quick the reservation of
 cars.
 So the system should provide users with real time information about availabilit
y of cars, their status and their positions.
 Users, after the reservation, can directly get their car in pre-defined
 parking areas.
 The service will be accessible only to registered users, giving some personal
 information and data needed to the payment.
 The price of the ride is computed with a fixed amount of money per minute,
 displayed by the car, and finally charged.
 To avoid useless reservation, where a user doesn’t pick up the car, the
 reservation expires after a fixed time, the car returns available, and
 the user is charged with a fee.
 Cars must be locked in the safe areas, and only users that have made the
 reservation can unlock them.
 The software has to provide also management functionality for administrators
 and operators in order to ensure a simple managing of the system.

\end_inset

 part describe the audience and the main goals of this document.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathit{Scope}$
\end_inset

 part has to provide a description and scope of the software and explain
 the goals, objectives and benefits of the project.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset


\begin_inset Formula $\mathit{Reference}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathit{Documents}$

\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{\mathbf{Architectural}}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Design}$
\end_inset

: this section explain the relationship between the modules to achieve the
 complete functionality of the system (requirements defined in the RASD).
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

It contains an high level overview of how responsibility of the system were
 partitioned and then assigned to subsystem (components).
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

In this part of the document are identified each high level subsystem and
 the roles or responsibility assigned to it in order to achieve a more detailed
 comprehension of the software to be.
 It's also described how these components collaborate with each other in
 order to achieve desired functionality.
 There is a focus on the interface provided by individual components in
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathit{Component}$

\end_inset

 section.
\begin_inset Newline newline
