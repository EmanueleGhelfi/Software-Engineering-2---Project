\begin_layout Standard
This software design document describes the architectures and the system
 design of Power EnJoy.
 It's intended mainly for developers but it has a hierarchical structure.
 It completes the RASD and defines the component that led to the satisfaction
 of the goals previous defined.
 It starts from an high level description of the architecture and then it
 goes into detail.

Scope

\begin_layout Standard
PowerEnJoy is a software that manages a car sharing service for electric
 cars.
 The aim of this software is to make simple and quick the reservation of
 cars.
 So the system should provide users with real time information about availabilit
y of cars, their status and their positions.
 Users, after the reservation, can directly get their car in pre-defined
 parking areas.
 The service will be accessible only to registered users, giving some personal
 information and data needed to the payment.
 The price of the ride is computed with a fixed amount of money per minute,
 displayed by the car, and finally charged.
 To avoid useless reservation, where a user doesnâ€™t pick up the car, the
 reservation expires after a fixed time, the car returns available, and
 the user is charged with a fee.
 Cars must be locked in the safe areas, and only users that have made the
 reservation can unlock them.
 The software has to provide also management functionality for administrators
 and operators in order to ensure a simple managing of the system.
