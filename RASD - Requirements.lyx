User Interface
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
\align left
In order to make PowerEnJoy available for many people as possible, a Cross-Platf
orm application has to be developed, with a Framework like Xamarin.
 In this way, a single application could be developed and then deployed
 for Windows Phone, Android and iOS.
 A Web Application has also to be developed in order to allow people to
 use our system in many way as possible.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The User Interface needs to be as user friendly as possible: that's to say
 that a user who uses Power EnJoy for the first time should be able to learn
 in a few seconds how to make use of it.
 
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Screens here presented provide an example of the UI and the main functions
 of the system.

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Security
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system has to satisfy an high level of security regarding the communication
 protocol with the cars.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The communication with the cars needs to be encrypted in order to avoid
 unauthorized unlocks and use.
 Futhermore the system should have the way to stop cars when used in an
 unauthorized way.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Regarding the security of payment, the system does't care about it because
 it relies on external payment system.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

Another critical security point is the managing of user's information: all
 user informations need to be encrypted before being sent.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Availability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The application needs to be online 24h/day and 7day/week in order to satisfy
 all users.
 This is a constraints because an hour of unavailablity could induce users
 to use another car sharing service.
 To achieve an high level of availability could be necessary to use a dedicated
 server and all the system could be hosted in a cloud platform like OVH.
 The system should be able to support a high number of users connected at
 the same time and could be necessary to scale resources depending on this.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Portability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The client-part of the system (application) could be used on any mobile
 OS in order to make it available for as many people as possible.
 It is expected a Web Application to increase the possible number of users.
\begin_inset Newline newline
\end_inset

The server-part of the system could be used on any OS which supports JVM
 and DBMS.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Maintainability
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The system code will be documented in order to make easier future improvements
 or changes by other developers.
 It needs to be clear how the system works, how the system communicate with
 cars, and how the system has been developed.
