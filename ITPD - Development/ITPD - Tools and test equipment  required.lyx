\begin_layout Section
Tools and Test Equipment Required
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sec:Tools-and-Test"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this section are specified all tools and test equipment required in order
 to perform integration testing of the previous sections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Testing Tools
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Testing tools are required in order to perform in an effective way tests
 described before.
 Since for the server part JEE technology has been used, there is the need
 of testing framework compatible with that technology.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The first testing tool needed is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Arquillian}$
\end_inset

.
 Arquillian makes easy to create integration testing.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In the integration testing phase Arquillian is used for:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Managing the lifecycle of the container (or containers) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Bundling the test case, dependent classes and resources into a ShrinkWrap
 archive (or archives) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Deploying the archive (or archives) to the container (or containers) 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Enriching the test case by providing dependency injection and other declarative
 services
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Executing the tests inside (or against) the container 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Capturing the results and returning them to the test runner for reporting
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With Arquillian integration phase is accelerated.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Although the integration strategy is bottom up, sometimes there is the need
 of stub.
 In order to create stubs we need something like 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Mockito}$
\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Mockito allows to:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Abstract dependencies
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Have predictable results
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Check the interaction between the caller and the mocked object.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to do be more effective 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{JUnit}$
\end_inset

 framework will be used.
 JUnit is a framework used mainly for Unit Testing but it can be also used
 for integration testing (for example to test if the interaction between
 components is happing in the correct way).
 There is the possibility to test if the correct parameter are passed to
 certain methods, if the method returns the expected result or raises the
 excepted exceptions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another testing tool that could be useful is 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{JUnitEE}$
\end_inset

 .
 This framework extends the standard JUnit so that it can execute unit tests
 in an application server container.
 It is configured in the J2EE Web module of a unit test application, and
 it uses a TestRunner to output HTML or XML test results.
 It also includes a TestServlet for an entry point to JUnit test cases.
 Building your test harness as a standard J2EE Web offers several benefits:
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tests are packaged in a J2EE Web module (in a WAR file), which is easy to
 deploy and execute.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Test cases look just like production code, and they can use the same Java
 beans that you use as a facade for your EJBs.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Tests can be automated by using an 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Ant}$
\end_inset

 script.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In order to perform some performance test 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{Apache}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{JMeter}$
\end_inset

 will be used.
 It can be used to simulate a heavy load on a server, network or object
 to test its strength or to analyze overall performance under different
 load types.
 In our software JMeter can be useful also for parametric and automated
 test on Authentication Manager and for testing the performance of the Car
 Proxy component.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the software to be will be running on different platforms, in order
 to test the client part are necessary all debuggers and testing tool related
 to the target OS (Windows Phone, Android, iOS).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that to perform the tests described in the previous sections some
 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{manual}$
\end_inset

 
\begin_inset Formula $\mathbf{testing}$
\end_inset

 will be necessary.
 This is intended in term of preparing correct test data for every test
 case.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As a summary, the following testing tools are required:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Arquillian
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Mockito
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
JUnit
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
JUnitEE
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
JMeter
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Test Equipment
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some test equipment are required to test the software to be.
 Test equipment is divided among the different part of the system they are
 needed.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Mobile Side
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Since the application will be running on different platforms there is the
 necessity to ensure the correct behavior on them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For testing the client side of the software the following devices are required:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some Android smartphones and tablets with several screen sizes and resolution.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
Some WP smartphones with several screen sizes and resolutions.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One iOS smartphone for each generation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Itemize
One iOS tablet for each generation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Web Side
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The web application will be tested using different notebooks and desktop
 computers.
 Like what concern the mobile side, the computers need to have different
 screen size and different resolutions.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The web application need to be tested with different browsers (e.g.
 Safari, Google Chrome, Firefox, Opera, Microsoft Edge).
 It's important also to test the web side on the mobile devices listed above.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Car Side
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The most critical part of the system regards the interaction with the car.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
It could be useful (but maybe not feasible) for testing purposes to have
 a board that simulates the car with carOS installed on it.
 This could be used to test the system interaction with the carOS in an
 easier way with respect to test it on the car itself.
 This must be discussed with the company of the carOS.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also a software that simulates the car and his OS is needed to make testing
 simpler.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Notice that the carOS won't be tested because there is the assumption that
 is a commercial system already present on the market.
 What will be tested will be the interaction between the software to be
 and that system.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection*
Server Side
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The testing environment needs to be very similar to the production environment
 to minimize the possibility of production error.
 The DBMS and the Application Server will be the same as the production.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Also the OS under the Application Server needs to be the same as the OS
 of the production environment.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the sake of limit testing cost the testing version of the environment
 could be a scaled down version of the production environment.
