\subsection{Use Case Diagram}

With the Use Case Diagram are highlighted the main function of our
system and the interaction between ACTORS and the related Use Case.

\subsection{Sequence Diagram}

With Sequence Diagram are highlighted the main function of the system
and the High-Level sequence of actions that focuses on the way in
which happens the interaction between ACTORS and system.

\subsubsection{Registration}
\begin{flushleft}
\begin{tabular}{|c|>{\raggedright}p{10cm}|}
\hline 
$\boldsymbol{\mathbf{Name}}$ & Registration\tabularnewline
\hline 
$\mathbf{Actors}$ & Guest\tabularnewline
\hline 
$\mathbf{Goal}$ & All\tabularnewline
\hline 
$\mathbf{EntryConditions}$ & Guest isn't already registered to the application.\tabularnewline
\hline 
$\mathbf{EventFlow}$ & \begin{enumerate}
\item Guest opens the app.
\item Guest click on Sign Up button.
\item Guest fills in all mandatory fields like payment informations, his
vital statistics etc.
\item Form is sent to the server that saves all data in the DB.
\item Email with registration confirmation is sent by the server to the
email address provided in the form.
\end{enumerate}
\tabularnewline
\hline 
$\mathbf{Output}$ $\mathbf{Condition}$ & GUEST ends registration procedure and become a USER. Now he/she can
login and use all functionalities offeredby the system.\tabularnewline
\hline 
$\mathbf{Exception}$ & \begin{enumerate}
\item Payment informations are not valid.
\item Driving License in not valid.
\item Username is already used by another user.
\item One or more mandatory fields of the form are not valid.
\end{enumerate}
In all this case the visitor is alert and the app explains the problem.
Then the app goes back to point 3 of Event Flow.\tabularnewline

\hline 
$\mathbf{Exception}$ & \begin{enumerate}
\item User's credentials are incorrect.
\item User is banned to the system (due to an incorrect behaviour).
\end{enumerate}
In the first case the user is notified that his/her credentials are
incorrect. \\
In the second case the user is notified that he can't use the service
because of his behaviour. \tabularnewline

In the first case app notifies the user that he needs to select another
car in order to make his reservation. App returns to point 1 of Event
Flow.

In the second case appp notifies user that he has already reserved
another car and that he can't reserve more than one car at the same
time.\tabularnewline
